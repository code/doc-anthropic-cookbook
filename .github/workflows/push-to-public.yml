          **Workflow Run:** ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

          - Divergent history between branches
          - Concurrent changes pushed to public repo
          - Permission or authentication issues

          **Action Required:**
          1. Check the workflow logs for specific error details
          2. Verify the public repository state
          3. If needed, manually sync: \`git push public public:main\`
          4. Resolve any conflicts if they exist
