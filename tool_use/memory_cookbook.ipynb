    "## 1. Introduction: Why Memory Matters {#introduction}\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates practical implementations of the context engineering patterns described in [Effective context engineering for AI agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents). That post covers why context is a finite resource, how attention budgets work, and strategies for building effective agents—the techniques you'll see in action here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models have finite context windows (200k tokens for Claude 4). While this seems large, several challenges emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context limits**: Long conversations or complex tasks can exceed available context\n",
    "- **Computational cost**: Processing large contexts is expensive - attention mechanisms scale quadratically\n",
    "- **Repeated patterns**: Similar tasks across conversations require re-explaining context every time\n",
    "- **Information loss**: When context fills up, earlier important information gets lost\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude 4 models introduce powerful context management capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Tool** (`memory_20250818`): Enables cross-conversation learning\n",
    "   - Claude can write down what it learns for future reference\n",
    "   - File-based system under `/memories` directory\n",
    "   - Client-side implementation gives you full control\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Editing**: Automatically manages context with two strategies:\n",
    "   - **Tool use clearing** (`clear_tool_uses_20250919`): Clears old tool results when context grows large\n",
    "   - **Thinking management** (`clear_thinking_20251015`): Manages extended thinking blocks (requires thinking enabled)\n",
    "   - Configurable triggers and retention policies\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Benefit\n",
    "\n",
    "Build AI agents that **get better at your specific tasks over time**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Session 1**: Claude solves a problem, writes down the pattern\n",
    "- **Session 2**: Claude applies the learned pattern immediately (faster!)\n",
    "- **Long sessions**: Context editing keeps conversations manageable\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as giving Claude a notebook to take notes and refer back to - just like humans do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this cookbook, you will be able to:\n",
    "- **Implement** the memory tool for cross-conversation learning\n",
    "- **Configure** context editing to manage long-running sessions\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem:** Multiple threads are calling `list.append()` on the shared `self.results` list simultaneously. While Python's `list.append()` is *technically* atomic at the bytecode level due to the GIL, **the real issue is that results from multiple threads in `as_completed()` are being processed in the main thread**, so this isn't actually the race condition causing lost results.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### **3. THE ACTUAL BUG: Instance Reuse** ⚠️\n",
      "The **real problem** causing inconsistent counts is:\n",
      "- `self.results` and `self.failed_urls` are **never cleared** between runs\n",
      "- If you call `scrape_urls()` multiple times on the same instance, results accumulate\n",
      "- But more critically: the lists are **class instance variables** that persist\n",

      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Race Conditions on Shared State** (Severity: HIGH)\n",
      "**Location:** Lines 11-12, 49-53\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "self.responses = []  # Multiple coroutines append to this\n",
      "self.error_count = 0  # Multiple coroutines increment this\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem:** While Python's GIL provides *some* protection for threads, **async coroutines can still interleave operations**. When a coroutine yields (e.g., at `await`), another coroutine can run and modify the same data structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact:**\n",
      "- List operations like `append()` *might* be atomic in CPython, but relying on this is implementation-dependent and fragile\n",
      "- Counter increments (`self.error_count += 1`) involve read-modify-write and are **NOT atomic**\n",
      "- Can lead to lost updates and incorrect counts\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Misleading Comment** (Severity: MEDIUM)\n",
      "**Location:** Line 50\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Not thread-safe in async context!\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem:** The comment mentions \"thread-safe\" but this is async code, not threaded code. The issue is about **coroutine-safety** or **concurrency-safety**, not thread-safety per se.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Missing Error Responses in Results** (Severity: MEDIUM)\n",
      "**Location:** Lines 49-53\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "if \"error\" in result:\n",
      "    self.error_count += 1  # Not atomic!\n",
      "else:\n",
      "    self.responses.append(result)  # Only success responses saved\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem:** Error responses are counted but not stored, so you lose valuable debugging information. The returned list only contains successful responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **State Accumulation Bug** (Severity: HIGH)\n",
      "**Location:** Throughout class\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem:** If `fetch_all()` is called multiple times on the same instance, results accumulate:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "client = AsyncAPIClient(\"...\")\n",
      "await client.fetch_all(endpoints1)  # Gets 10 results\n",
      "await client.fetch_all(endpoints2)  # Now has 10 + 20 = 30 results!\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### ⚠️ Design Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. **Unnecessary Instance State**\n",
      "The class stores results as instance variables when they could be local variables returned by the method. This violates the principle of minimal mutable state.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 6. **Inconsistent Error Handling**\n",
      "The `get_summary()` method calculates success rate but might divide by zero if no requests were made (though there's a guard for this).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do:**\n",
    "- ✅ Store task-relevant patterns, not conversation history\n",
    "- ✅ Organize with clear directory structure\n",
    "- ✅ Use descriptive file names\n",
    "- ✅ Periodically review and clean up memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't:**\n",
    "- ❌ Store sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII)\n",
    "- ❌ Let memory grow unbounded\n",
    "- ❌ Store everything indiscriminately\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security: Path Traversal Protection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical**: Always validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. See `memory_tool.py` for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security: Memory Poisoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Critical Risk**: Memory files are read back into Claude's context, making them a potential vector for prompt injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation strategies:**\n",
    "1. **Content Sanitization**: Filter dangerous patterns before storing\n",
    "2. **Memory Scope Isolation**: Per-user/per-project isolation  \n",
    "3. **Memory Auditing**: Log and scan all memory operations\n",
    "4. **Prompt Engineering**: Instruct Claude to ignore instructions in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "See `memory_tool.py` for complete security implementation and tests in `tests/`."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, you learned to:\n",
    "- ✅ **Implement the memory tool** for cross-conversation learning (Sessions 1 & 2 showed pattern recognition persisting)\n",
    "- ✅ **Configure context editing** with token triggers and retention policies (Session 3 demonstrated automatic clearing)\n",
    "- ✅ **Apply security best practices** including path validation and memory poisoning prevention\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying These Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**For your projects:**\n",
    "1. Start with a single memory file for patterns (e.g., `/memories/patterns.md`)\n",
    "2. Set context editing triggers at 30-40k tokens for production use\n",
    "3. Implement per-project memory isolation to prevent cross-contamination\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other applications:**\n",
    "- **Customer support**: Store user preferences and common issue resolutions\n",
    "- **Research assistants**: Accumulate domain knowledge across sessions\n",
    "- **Data analysis**: Remember dataset characteristics and successful techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production deployment**: Use [claude-code-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) for GitHub PR reviews\n",
    "- **Security hardening**: Review the memory poisoning mitigations in `memory_tool.py`\n",
    "- **Extended thinking**: Explore thinking management for compute-intensive tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Memory tool documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool)\n",
    "- [Claude API reference](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages)\n",
