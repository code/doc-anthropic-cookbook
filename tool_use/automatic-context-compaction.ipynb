    "# Automatic Context Compaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-running agentic tasks can often exceed context limits. Tool heavy workflows or long conversations quickly consume the token context window. In [Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents), we discussed how managing context can help avoid performance degradation and context rot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Claude Agent Python SDK can help manage this context by automatically compressing conversation history when token usage exceeds a configurable threshold, allowing tasks to continue beyond the typical 200k token context limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we'll demonstrate context compaction through an **agentic customer service workflow**. Imagine you've built an AI customer service agent tasked with processing a queue of support tickets. For each ticket, you must classify the issue, search the knowledge base, set priority, route to the appropriate team, draft a response, and mark it complete. As you process ticket after ticket, the conversation history fills with classifications, knowledge base searches, and drafted responses—quickly consuming thousands of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Context Compaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "When building agentic workflows with tool use, conversations can grow very large as the agent iterates on complex tasks. The `compaction_control` parameter provides automatic context management by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monitoring token usage per turn in the conversation\n",
    "2. When a threshold is exceeded, injecting a summary prompt as a user turn\n",
    "3. Having the model generate a summary wrapped in `<summary></summary>` tags. These tags aren't parsed, but are there to help guide the model.\n",
    "4. Clearing the conversation history and resuming with only the summary\n",
    "5. Continuing the task with the compressed context\n",
    "\n",
    "## By the end of this cookbook, you'll be able to:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Understand how to effectively manage context limits in iterative workflows\n",
    " - Write agents that leverage automatic context compaction\n",

    "- Store **every classification, every knowledge base search, every drafted response** in memory\n",

    "**Why This Happens**:\n",
    "1. **Linear token growth** - With each tool use, the entire conversation history (including all previous tool results) is sent to Claude\n",
    "2. **Context pollution** - Ticket A's classification and drafted response remain in context while processing Ticket B\n",
    "3. **Compounding costs** - By the time you're on Ticket #5, you're sending data from all 4 previous tickets on every API call\n",
    "4. **Slower responses** - Processing massive contexts takes longer\n",
    "5. **Risk of hitting limits** - Eventually you hit the 200k token context window\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Actually Need**: After completing Ticket A, we only need a **brief summary** (ticket resolved, category, priority) - not the full classification result, knowledge base search, and complete drafted response.

    "3. **Task completes successfully** - The workflow continues smoothly through all tickets without hitting context limits\n",

    "### Custom Summary Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide a custom prompt to guide how summaries are generated. This is especially useful for customer service workflows where you need to preserve specific types of information.\n",

    "For example, we could define a custom prompt based on our requirements:\n",

    "## Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While automatic context compaction is powerful, there are important limitations to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server-Side Sampling Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Limitation**: Compaction does not work optimally with server-side sampling loops, such as server-side web search tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Cache tokens accumulate across sampling loops, which can trigger compaction prematurely based on cached content rather than actual conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature works best with:\n",
    "- ✅ Client-side tools (like the customer service API in this cookbook)\n",
    "- ✅ Standard agentic workflows with regular tool use\n",
    "- ✅ File operations, database queries, API calls\n",
    "- ❌ Server-side Extended Thinking\n",
    "- ❌ Server-side web search tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off**: Summaries inherently lose some information. While Claude is good at identifying key points, some details will be compressed or omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In ticket processing**: \n",
    "- ✅ **Retained**: Ticket IDs, categories, priorities, teams, outcomes, progress status\n",
    "- ❌ **Lost**: Full knowledge base article text, complete drafted response text, detailed classification reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually acceptable, you don't need every KB article and full response text in perpetuity, just the completion records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation**:\n",
    "- Use custom summary prompts to preserve critical information\n",
    "- Set higher thresholds for tasks requiring extensive historical context\n",
    "- Structure your tasks to be modular (each phase builds on summaries, not raw details)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to Use Compaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid compaction for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short tasks**: If your task completes within 50k-100k tokens, compaction adds unnecessary overhead\n",
    "2. **Tasks requiring full audit trails**: Some tasks need access to ALL previous details\n",
    "3. **Server-side sampling workflows**: As mentioned above, wait for this limitation to be addressed\n",
    "4. **Highly iterative refinement**: Tasks where each step critically depends on exact details from all previous steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### When TO Use Compaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Compaction is ideal for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential processing**: Like our ticket workflow—process multiple items one after another\n",
    "2. **Multi-phase workflows**: Where each phase can summarize progress before moving on\n",
    "3. **Iterative data processing**: Processing large datasets in chunks or entities one at a time\n",
    "4. **Extended analysis sessions**: Analyzing data across many entities\n",
    "5. **Batch operations**: Processing hundreds of items where each is independent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ticket processing is a perfect use case** because:\n",
    "- Each ticket workflow is largely independent\n",
    "- You need completion summaries, not full tool results\n",
    "- Natural compaction points exist (after completing several tickets)\n",
    "- The workflow is iterative and sequential"
