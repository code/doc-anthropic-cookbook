    "# Automatic Context Compaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-running agentic tasks can often exceed context limits. Tool heavy workflows or long conversations quickly consume the token context window. In [Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents), we discussed how managing context can help avoid performance degradation and context rot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Claude Agent Python SDK can help manage this context by automatically compressing conversation history when token usage exceeds a configurable threshold, allowing tasks to continue beyond the typical 200k token context limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we'll demonstrate context compaction through an **agentic customer service workflow**. Imagine you've built an AI customer service agent tasked with processing a queue of support tickets. For each ticket, you must classify the issue, search the knowledge base, set priority, route to the appropriate team, draft a response, and mark it complete. As you process ticket after ticket, the conversation history fills with classifications, knowledge base searches, and drafted responses—quickly consuming thousands of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Context Compaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "When building agentic workflows with tool use, conversations can grow very large as the agent iterates on complex tasks. The `compaction_control` parameter provides automatic context management by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monitoring token usage across the conversation\n",
    "2. When a threshold is exceeded, injecting a summary prompt as a user turn\n",
    "3. Having the model generate a summary wrapped in `<summary></summary>` tags\n",
    "4. Clearing the conversation history and resuming with only the summary\n",
    "5. Continuing the task with the compressed context\n",
    "\n",
    "## By the end of this cookbook, you'll be able to:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Understand how to effectively manage context limits in iterative workflows\n",
    " - Write agents that leverage automatic context compaction\n",

    "## Setting the Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "In [utils/customer_service_tools.py](utils/customer_service_tools.py), we've defined several functions for processing customer support tickets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_next_ticket()` - Retrieves the next unprocessed ticket from the queue\n",
    "- `classify_ticket(ticket_id, category)` - Categorizes issues as billing, technical, account, product, or shipping\n",
    "- `search_knowledge_base(query)` - Finds relevant help articles and solutions\n",
    "- `set_priority(ticket_id, priority)` - Assigns priority levels (low, medium, high, urgent)\n",
    "- `route_to_team(ticket_id, team)` - Routes tickets to the appropriate support team\n",
    "- `draft_response(ticket_id, response_text)` - Creates customer-facing responses\n",
    "- `mark_complete(ticket_id)` - Finalizes processed tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "For a customer service agent, these tools enable processing tickets systematically. Each ticket requires classification, research, prioritization, routing, and response drafting. When processing 20-30 tickets in sequence, the conversation history fills with tool results from every classification, every knowledge base search, and every drafted response, causing exponential token growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by using the `beta_tool` decorator to import these functions as tools for our agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import anthropic\n",
    "from anthropic import beta_tool\n",
    "\n",

    "    \"\"\"Retrieve the next unprocessed support ticket from the queue.\"\"\"\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our API already has the functions defined using the `beta_tool` decoractor, so we can import them and use them with the Claude API directly here."

    "Let's start with a realistic customer service scenario: Processing a queue of support tickets. The workflow looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Each Ticket:**\n",
    "1. Fetch the ticket using `get_next_ticket()`\n",
    "2. Classify the issue category (billing, technical, account, product, shipping)\n",
    "3. Search the knowledge base for relevant information\n",

    "8. Move to the next ticket\n",

    "**The Challenge**: With 5 tickets in the queue, and each requiring 7 tool calls, Claude will make 35 tool calls. The results from each step including classificationk knowledge base search, and drafted responses accumulate in the conversation history. Without compaction, all this data stays in memory for every ticket, by ticket #5, the context includes complete details from all 4 previous tickets.\n",

    "### Understanding the Problem\n",

    "- Process **5 support tickets** sequentially\n",
    "- Complete **7 steps per ticket** (fetch, classify, research, prioritize, route, draft, complete)\n",
    "- Make **35 tool calls** with results accumulating in conversation history\n",
    "- Store **every classification, every knowledge base search, every drafted response** in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Happens**:\n",
    "1. **Exponential token growth** - With each tool use, the entire conversation history (including all previous tool results) is sent to Claude\n",
    "2. **Context pollution** - Ticket A's classification and drafted response remain in context while processing Ticket B\n",
    "3. **Compounding costs** - By the time you're on Ticket #5, you're sending data from all 4 previous tickets on every API call\n",
    "4. **Slower responses** - Processing massive contexts takes longer\n",
    "5. **Risk of hitting limits** - Eventually you hit the 200k token context window\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Actually Need**: After completing Ticket A, we only need a **brief summary** (ticket resolved, category, priority) - not the full classification result, knowledge base search, and complete drafted response.

    "\n",
    "You can customize how compaction works to fit your specific use case. Here are the key configuration options:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusting the Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The `context_token_threshold` determines when compaction triggers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "compaction_control={\n",
    "    \"enabled\": True,\n",
    "    \"context_token_threshold\": 5000,  # Compact after processing 5-7 tickets\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines:**\n",
    "- **Very low thresholds (5k-20k)**: \n",
    "  - Use for iterative task processing with clear boundaries\n",
    "  - Our customer service workflow uses 5k to compact after processing several tickets\n",
    "  - More frequent compaction, minimal context accumulation\n",
    "  - Best for sequential entity processing\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Medium thresholds (50k-100k)**: \n",
    "  - Multi-phase workflows with fewer, larger natural checkpoints\n",
    "  - Balance between context retention and management\n",
    "  - Suitable for workflows with expensive tool calls\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **High thresholds (100k-150k)**: \n",
    "  - Tasks requiring substantial historical context\n",
    "  - Less frequent compaction preserves more raw details\n",
    "  - Higher per-call costs but fewer compactions\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Default (150k)**: Good balance for general long-running tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**For ticket processing**: The 5k threshold works well because each ticket's workflow generates substantial tool results, but tickets are independent. After resolving Ticket A, you don't need its detailed KB searches when processing Ticket B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Different Model for Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a faster/cheaper model for generating summaries:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "compaction_control={\n",
    "    \"enabled\": True,\n",
    "    \"model\": \"claude-haiku-4-5\",  # Use Haiku for cost-effective summaries\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "When using automatic context compaction, follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Choose the Right Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start with the default (150k)** for most workflows\n",
    "- **Lower thresholds (5k-20k)** for:\n",
    "  - **Iterative processing** like our ticket workflow (compact after processing several items)\n",
    "  - **Multi-phase workflows** with natural checkpoints\n",
    "  - Very long-running tasks that need many iterations\n",
    "  - Cost-sensitive applications\n",
    "  - Tasks where older context becomes less relevant\n",
    "- **Higher thresholds (100k-150k)** for:\n",
    "  - Tasks requiring detailed historical context across all phases\n",
    "  - Complex reasoning that builds on previous steps\n",
    "  - Workflows with expensive tool calls where you want to minimize repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "**For ticket processing**: A threshold of 5k-10k works well because each ticket workflow is self-contained. After resolving Ticket A, you don't need its detailed tool results when processing Ticket B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Craft Effective Summary Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Good summary prompts should specify:\n",
    "- **What to preserve**: Critical information, IDs, categories, outcomes, progress\n",
    "- **Format**: Structured output helps maintain consistency\n",
    "- **Context**: Remind Claude of the task and current phase\n",
    "- **Next steps**: What remains to be done\n",
    "\n",
    "Example for ticket processing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "summary_prompt = \"\"\"You are processing customer support tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include in your summary:\n",
    "- COMPLETED: Brief record of each ticket (ID, category, priority, team, outcome)\n",
    "- PROGRESS: Tickets completed vs remaining\n",
    "- NEXT: Continue processing remaining tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap in <summary></summary> tags.\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use Appropriate Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main task**: Use the model best suited for the task (Sonnet, Haiku)\n",
    "- **Summarization**: Consider using Haiku for cost savings if summaries don't require complex reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "compaction_control={\n",
    "    \"enabled\": True,\n",
    "    \"model\": \"claude-haiku-4-5\",  # Cheaper summaries\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Monitor Compaction Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Track when compaction occurs to optimize your threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "messages_list = list(runner._params[\"messages\"])\n",
    "curr_msg_count = len(messages_list)\n",

    "- ✅ Client-side tools (like the customer service API in this cookbook)\n",
    "- ✅ Standard agentic workflows with regular tool use\n",
    "- ✅ File operations, database queries, API calls\n",
    "- ❌ Server-side Extended Thinking\n",
    "- ❌ Server-side web search tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off**: Summaries inherently lose some information. While Claude is good at identifying key points, some details will be compressed or omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In ticket processing**: \n",
    "- ✅ **Retained**: Ticket IDs, categories, priorities, teams, outcomes, progress status\n",
    "- ❌ **Lost**: Full knowledge base article text, complete drafted response text, detailed classification reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually acceptable—you don't need every KB article and full response text in perpetuity, just the completion records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation**:\n",
    "- Use custom summary prompts to preserve critical information\n",
    "- Set higher thresholds for tasks requiring extensive historical context\n",
    "- Structure your tasks to be modular (each phase builds on summaries, not raw details)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to Use Compaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid compaction for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short tasks**: If your task completes within 50k-100k tokens, compaction adds unnecessary overhead\n",
    "2. **Tasks requiring full audit trails**: Some tasks need access to ALL previous details\n",
    "3. **Server-side sampling workflows**: As mentioned above, wait for this limitation to be addressed\n",
    "4. **Highly iterative refinement**: Tasks where each step critically depends on exact details from all previous steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### When TO Use Compaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Compaction is ideal for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential processing**: Like our ticket workflow—process multiple items one after another\n",
    "2. **Multi-phase workflows**: Where each phase can summarize progress before moving on\n",
    "3. **Iterative data processing**: Processing large datasets in chunks or entities one at a time\n",
    "4. **Extended analysis sessions**: Analyzing data across many entities\n",
    "5. **Batch operations**: Processing hundreds of items where each is independent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ticket processing is a perfect use case** because:\n",
    "- Each ticket workflow is largely independent\n",
    "- You need completion summaries, not full tool results\n",
    "- Natural compaction points exist (after completing several tickets)\n",
    "- The workflow is iterative and sequential"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic context compaction is a powerful feature that enables long-running agentic workflows to exceed typical context limits. In this cookbook, we've explored compaction through a customer service ticket processing workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Problem**: Without compaction, iterative workflows face severe challenges:\n",
    "   - **Context accumulation**: Processing Ticket #10 means carrying tool results from Tickets #1-9\n",
    "   - **Exponential token growth**: Each new ticket adds to an ever-growing context\n",
    "   - **High costs**: Thousands of unnecessary tokens sent with each API call\n",
    "   - **Context limits**: Risk of hitting 200k token limit before completing all tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Solution**: The `compaction_control` parameter automates context management:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   compaction_control={\n",
    "       \"enabled\": True,\n",
    "       \"context_token_threshold\": 5000,  # Compact after processing several tickets\n",
    "       \"model\": \"claude-haiku-4-5\",      # Optional, defaults to main model\n",
    "       \"summary_prompt\": \"...\"            # Optional, customize for your use case\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How It Works**: When tokens exceed the threshold, the SDK:\n",
    "   - Pauses the workflow\n",
    "   - Generates a summary of progress and completed tickets\n",
    "   - Clears the conversation history (discarding detailed tool results)\n",
    "   - Continues seamlessly with compressed context (retaining completion summaries)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real Impact**: In our ticket processing example, compaction enabled:\n",
    "   - Processing all 10 tickets with 70+ tool calls\n",
    "   - Managing classifications, KB searches, and drafted responses for each ticket\n",
    "   - **Significant token savings** (30-60%+ reduction in total tokens)\n",
    "   - **Successful completion** without hitting context limits\n",
    "   - **Quality preserved**: All tickets properly classified, prioritized, routed, and resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Natural Workflow**: Compaction mirrors how real support agents work:\n",
    "   - Process Ticket A thoroughly → Document completion briefly\n",
    "   - Close that ticket and clear your workspace\n",
    "   - Move to Ticket B with a clean slate\n",
    "   - At the end, all tickets are documented in the system\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You don't keep every knowledge base article and full response draft open while working on new tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Compaction\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Sequential processing (customer service, data processing)\n",
    "- ✅ Iterative workflows (process hundreds of items)\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-phase workflows with natural checkpoints\n",
    "- ✅ Tasks processing large volumes of tool results\n",
    "- ✅ Cost-sensitive production applications\n",
    "- ❌ Tasks requiring full, uncompressed conversation history\n",
    "- ❌ Server-side sampling loop workflows (current limitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Configuration Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5k-20k threshold**: For iterative processing with natural per-item compaction points\n",
    "- **50k-100k threshold**: For multi-phase workflows with fewer, larger compaction points\n",
    "- **150k threshold (default)**: For general long-running tasks\n",
    "- **Custom summary prompts**: Essential for preserving workflow-specific information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Try implementing compaction in your own workflows:\n",
    "1. Identify natural compaction points (after processing each item, completing each phase, etc.)\n",
    "2. Start with an aggressive threshold (5k-10k) if you have clear per-item boundaries\n",
    "3. Use custom summary prompts to preserve critical information\n",
    "4. Monitor when compaction triggers and verify quality is maintained\n",
    "5. Adjust threshold based on your specific needs\n",
