        "# Session Memory Compaction\n",
        "\n",
        "Long-running conversations with Claude can exceed context limits, causing loss of important information. Whether you're building a coding assistant, creative writing tool, or customer service agent, managing session memory is critical for maintaining continuity and quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "This cookbook teaches you how to **proactively manage session memory** to avoid jarring context limit interruptions. Unlike reactive approaches that wait until the context is full, you'll learn to build session memory in the background so compaction is instant when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Related:** For automatic SDK-based compaction in agentic workflows, see [Automatic Context Compaction](../tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb). This cookbook focuses on manual control patterns for conversational applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this cookbook, you will be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write effective session memory prompts that preserve critical context across compaction events\n",
        "- Implement **instant compaction** using background threading to eliminate user wait time\n",
        "- Apply prompt caching to reduce the cost of background memory updates by ~80%\n",
        "- Choose appropriate compaction strategies (traditional vs. instant) based on your use case"

An elderly cartographer named Eugene Fisk was found dead in his cluttered workshop, officially ruled a heart attack. But his daughter insists something's wrong: her father spent his final month frantically updating a massive hand-drawn map of the town—adding buildings that don't exist, removing ones that do, and marking dozens of red X's in seemingly random locations.\n",

The first one leads to an old park bench—underneath it, she finds a coffee can containing $2,300 in cash and a note: \"For the Hendersons' mortgage, June 1987.\" The second X marks a spot behind the defunct movie theater where she uncovers an envelope with photographs proving the former mayor's affair (the scandal that ended his career). The third X reveals a time capsule with a child's confession to starting the fire that burned down the elementary school forty years ago.\n",

            "**The Real Mystery:** Eugene wasn't murdered—but he wasn't mapping the town as it is. He was mapping every secret buried within it, physical and metaphorical. For sixty years, he'd been Shepherdstown's unofficial confessor. People would visit his workshop and tell him things they couldn't tell anyone else, and he'd mark them on his map in an elaborate code only he understood. In his final month, knowing he was dying, he decoded everything—creating a map that, if made public, would destroy half the town.\n",

            "**The Investigation:** Nora realizes someone is also following the map. Items are being dug up, locations disturbed. She races to decipher Eugene's system before this unknown person does. But the deeper she digs, the more she uncovers: covered-up deaths, stolen inheritances, a hit-and-run from 1992, evidence of who really embezzled the union funds that closed the mine. Every secret connects to another. The town isn't dying by accident—it's been poisoned from within by decades of buried truth.\n",

She blames these secrets—and the people who keep them—for turning Shepherdstown into a hollowed-out shell. Nora must decide: help her complete her father's final work and reveal every terrible truth, or destroy the map and let sleeping sins lie. The case becomes about whether a detective's job is to uncover the truth or to protect the living from what the truth will do to them.\n",

        "In this cookbook, you learned how to manage long-running Claude conversations through session memory compaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What We Covered\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Effective compaction prompts** - Structure your session memory to preserve user intent, completed work, errors, active work, and key references while discarding filler\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Instant compaction** - Use background threading to proactively build session memory, eliminating user wait time when context limits are reached\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Prompt caching for cost savings** - Reduce background update costs by ~80% by reusing the conversation prefix cache\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Traditional vs. instant patterns** - Understand when to use each approach based on your application needs\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Weight recency heavily** - The end of a conversation is the active working context\n",
        "2. **Preserve user corrections verbatim** - Prevents the model from reverting to old behaviors\n",
        "3. **Build memory proactively** - Don't wait for context limits; start background updates early\n",
        "4. **Leverage prompt caching** - Background summarization can share cache with the main conversation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "- **For agentic workflows**: See [Automatic Context Compaction](../tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb) for SDK-based automatic compaction with tool use\n",
        "- **For production**: Consider persisting session memory to disk rather than keeping it in memory\n",
        "- **For optimization**: Experiment with update frequency thresholds to balance cost vs. freshness"
