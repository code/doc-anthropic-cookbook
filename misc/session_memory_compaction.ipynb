    "**Why this works:**\n",
    "- The first background update creates a cache entry for `[System + Messages]`\n",
    "- Subsequent updates with the same message prefix get **cache hits**\n",
    "- Only the new summarization instruction is billed at full price\n",
    "- Cache entries have a 5-minute TTL, so rapid updates benefit most\n",

    "**Cost math:**\n",
    "- Without caching: 5,000 tokens × $3.00/1M = $0.015 per update\n",
    "- With caching: 500 new tokens × $3.00/1M + 4,500 cached × $0.30/1M = $0.00285\n",
