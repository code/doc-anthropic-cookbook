        "# Session Memory Compaction\n",
        "\n",
        "Long-running conversations with Claude can exceed context limits, causing loss of important information. Whether you're building a coding assistant, creative writing tool, or customer service agent, managing session memory is critical for maintaining continuity and quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "This cookbook teaches you how to **proactively manage session memory** to avoid jarring context limit interruptions. Unlike reactive approaches that wait until the context is full, you'll learn to build session memory in the background so compaction is instant when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Related:** For automatic SDK-based compaction in agentic workflows, see [Automatic Context Compaction](../tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb). This cookbook focuses on manual control patterns for conversational applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this cookbook, you will be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write effective session memory prompts that preserve critical context across compaction events\n",
        "- Implement **instant compaction** using background threading to eliminate user wait time\n",
        "- Apply prompt caching to reduce the cost of background memory updates by ~80%\n",
        "- Choose appropriate compaction strategies (traditional vs. instant) based on your use case"

Just an empty sanctuary and sheet music scattered across the floor.\n",

Now the mayor is dying and has hired someone to ensure his secret dies with him.

            "**Setup:** Your young detective arrives in the mountain town of Ridgeway to investigate what seems like a prank: someone has been systematically correcting the town's street signs, storefront addresses, and property markers—changing them by just one or two numbers. The post office is going insane. Mail is being misdelivered. Emergency services are getting lost. But here's the thing: the \"corrections\" match a 150-year-old town map that was supposedly drawn incorrectly by a disgraced surveyor who was run out of town and buried in an unmarked grave.\n",
            "\n",
            "**The Investigation:** The detective discovers the old surveyor wasn't wrong—he was *right*. The town founders deliberately falsified all records after his death, shifting every address, every property line, every boundary marker. Why? Because the real map would reveal that the town's most valuable land—now home to the founding families' estates, the town hall, the historic church—was actually purchased from a Native American family who were supposed to retain mineral rights and a percentage of all profits in perpetuity. \n",
            "\n",
            "**The Twist:** The person \"correcting\" the signs isn't a descendant of the surveyor or the Native family. It's a twelve-year-old girl with terminal cancer who found the original map in her grandmother's attic. She's not seeking revenge or restitution—she just became obsessed with the idea that the whole town has been living a lie written into the ground itself. Before she dies, she wants the truth to physically exist in the world, even if no one acknowledges it. She's been sneaking out at night with a screwdriver and homemade signs.\n",
            "\n",
            "**The Real Mystery:** The detective must decide what to do when they realize that \"solving\" the case—stopping the girl and restoring the false addresses—means choosing comfortable order over inconvenient truth. Meanwhile, members of the founding families are getting desperate to stop the corrections before anyone looks too closely at land deeds, and the girl's nightly trips are getting increasingly dangerous.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Why it works:** It subverts the detective genre by making the \"crime\" an act of radical honesty. The mystery isn't whodunit—it's what truth is worth when it would destroy an entire community's foundation. The villain isn't the child or even really the founding families—it's the town itself, built on a literal lie. And your detective can't punch or outwit their way out of a moral knot.\n",

        "In this cookbook, you learned how to manage long-running Claude conversations through session memory compaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What We Covered\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Effective compaction prompts** - Structure your session memory to preserve user intent, completed work, errors, active work, and key references while discarding filler\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Instant compaction** - Use background threading to proactively build session memory, eliminating user wait time when context limits are reached\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Prompt caching for cost savings** - Reduce background update costs by ~80% by reusing the conversation prefix cache\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Traditional vs. instant patterns** - Understand when to use each approach based on your application needs\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Weight recency heavily** - The end of a conversation is the active working context\n",
        "2. **Preserve user corrections verbatim** - Prevents the model from reverting to old behaviors\n",
        "3. **Build memory proactively** - Don't wait for context limits; start background updates early\n",
        "4. **Leverage prompt caching** - Background summarization can share cache with the main conversation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "- **For agentic workflows**: See [Automatic Context Compaction](../tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb) for SDK-based automatic compaction with tool use\n",
        "- **For production**: Consider persisting session memory to disk rather than keeping it in memory\n",
        "- **For optimization**: Experiment with update frequency thresholds to balance cost vs. freshness"
