    "Some best practices include:\n",
    "- Use chain-of-thought before summarizing — analyze first, then output                                                                                         \n",
    "- Enumerate exactly what to preserve: file paths, code snippets, errors, user corrections                                                                      \n",
    "- Weight recency heavily — the end of the conversation is the active context                                                                                   \n",

    "- Include a \"Current State\" section that always reflects the moment of compaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Some pitfalls include:\n",
    "- Vague prompts like \"summarize this conversation\" produce lossy output                                                                                        \n",

    "- Paraphrasing next steps introduces subtle drift that compounds                                                                                               \n",
    "- Omitting error history causes the model to retry failed approaches                                                                                           \n",
    "- Dropping user corrections makes the model revert to old behaviors                                                                                            \n",

      "# Three Mystery Plot Ideas\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **The Silence Pact**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Setup:** A beloved high school teacher dies in what appears to be a tragic accident during a school field trip to nearby caves. Our detective, fresh out of the academy and assigned to this sleepy town as a \"soft landing,\" is told it's an open-and-shut case. But something feels wrong—the students who were there have all gone eerily quiet, even with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Mystery:** As our detective digs deeper, they discover the students aren't protecting a person—they're protecting a secret about the town itself. Twenty years ago, another teacher disappeared during a similar field trip, and the current town leadership (mayor, police chief, school board) were all students on *that* trip. The dead teacher had discovered what really happened and was killed to keep the past buried.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Complication:** The detective's own mentor—the retiring detective they're replacing—was the lead investigator who closed the original case as a \"runaway.\" Solving this means destroying the man who gave them their career, and possibly exposing that he was complicit in the cover-up all along.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Emotional Core:** Justice vs. loyalty; the cost of truth in a community built on comfortable lies.\n",

      "\n",
      "Assistant: \n",
      "# **The Cartographer's Daughter**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Setup:** Our young detective arrives in a mountain town of 3,000 people to investigate a truly bizarre crime: someone has been systematically stealing *maps*. Not valuable antiques—just maps. From the library, the historical society, the ranger station, even GPS units from parked cars. The thefts escalate to break-ins, and finally, the town's oldest resident—a retired cartographer—is murdered in her home. All her maps, a lifetime of work documenting the region, are gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Mystery:** The detective discovers the cartographer had been deliberately mapping things *wrong* for sixty years. Roads that don't quite connect. Trails that dead-end where her maps say they continue. Property lines slightly off. She'd been systematically introducing tiny errors into every official map of the region, and her personal maps—the stolen ones—show what's *really* there.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's really there: an entire ghost neighborhood. Eight families have been living on what they believed was public land for three generations, building homes, raising children, completely off-grid. They thought they were just deeply rural. But the cartographer's accurate maps prove they're squatting on land owned by a development company that's just been sold. The new owners want to build a resort. The thefts weren't about the maps—they were about erasing proof that this land is occupied, so the families can be removed as \"trespassers\" rather than residents with potential legal claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Complication:** The detective finds the hidden community and realizes the murderer is one of the eight families—someone who killed the cartographer to *protect* everyone else, believing her death would end the investigation and the maps would never surface. But now the detective's investigation is doing exactly what the murder was meant to prevent: shining a spotlight on this vulnerable community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second complication: The detective discovers they're not the only one who knows. A surveyor has been hired by the development company and is systematically re-mapping the area. They'll \"discover\" the squatters any day now, and without the cartographer's maps showing 60 years of continuous occupation, the families have no legal standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Choice:** The detective can solve the murder—which means exposing the community and likely forcing eight families from their homes. Or they can bury the case, let a murderer go free, and give these families time to establish legal residency claims. Justice for one person, or protection for dozens.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Twist:** The cartographer's granddaughter, who hired the detective and has been helping the investigation, already knows about the hidden community—she grew up visiting them. Her grandmother was protecting them her whole career. The granddaughter wants the maps found not to solve the murder, but to establish the families' legal claims before the developers strike. She's been manipulating the investigation from the start, using the detective as an unwitting advocate.\n",

      "Maya grew up in a multi-generational household in a tight-knit immigrant community—her grandmother escaped war in the Balkans with false papers, her parents were undocumented for the first decade in America. She was eight years old when ICE raided their neighborhood. Her family wasn't taken (her mother had just gotten her green card), but her best friend's entire family was deported overnight. The girl was at Maya's house for a sleepover. In the morning, she had no home to return to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maya became *obsessed* with rules after that. If her family followed every rule perfectly, kept every paper in order, never gave anyone a reason to look twice—they'd be safe. She color-coded her parents' documents. She learned immigration law as a teenager. She became a cop because she believed that being on the \"inside\" of the system meant understanding how to protect people from it.\n",

Immigrant family background—grandmother escaped with false papers, childhood friend\\'s family deported by ICE when Maya was 8. Became obsessive about rules/systems as protection mechanism. Requested small-town assignment seeking \"simpler\" justice, avoiding moral complexity.

      "Create a mystery story about a young detective in a small town. User rejected initial conventional plots as not unique enough, specifically requesting \"something more unique and unexpected.\" Accepted \"The Cartographer's Daughter\" concept and proceeded to develop it fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Completed Work\n",
      "**Story concept created**: \"The Cartographer's Daughter\" - A young detective investigates map thefts and a murder in a mountain town, discovering the victim falsified maps for 60 years to hide a community of families living on privately-owned land they believed was public forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main character developed**: Maya Kovač, 27, new detective (4 months experience). Immigrant family background—grandmother escaped with false papers, childhood friend's family deported by ICE when Maya was 8. Became obsessive about rules/systems as protection mechanism. Requested small-town assignment seeking \"simpler\" justice, avoiding moral complexity. Character arc: must learn that protecting people sometimes requires working against the system, not within it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Supporting cast**: Chief Warren Hayes (58, retiring in 6 weeks, will recommend Maya as chief); Iris Farkas (32, art teacher, Elena's granddaughter, secretly manipulating investigation); Elena Farkas (89, murdered cartographer); Thomas Wade (52, hidden community leader, will be revealed as killer); Daniel Reeves (41, corporate surveyor); Scott Chen (35, ranger); 8 families in hidden settlement \"Millbrook Heights.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Detailed outline created**: 13-chapter structure spanning 3 acts:\n",
      "- Act 1: Map thefts lead to Elena's murder, Maya discovers discrepancies in maps\n",
      "- Act 2: Maya finds hidden community, learns Iris has been manipulating her, discovers Elena's accurate maps in storage unit\n",
      "- Act 3: Thomas confesses to accidental killing, Maya must choose between justice and protection\n",
      "\n",
      "**Two complete chapters drafted**:\n",
      "- Chapter 1 (~2,000 words): Maya arrives in Millbrook, meets Hayes, learns about map thefts, given case as \"orientation,\" promoted to future chief (unexpected), notices town feels \"smaller than maps suggest\"\n",
      "- Chapter 2 (~2,500 words): Elena's murder discovered, crime scene investigation, learns surveyor Reeves found GPS discrepancies with Elena's maps, Margaret Yates (neighbor) mentions development company visit, chapter ends with Iris arriving at station\n",
      "\n",
      "## Errors & Corrections\n",
      "User's only correction: rejected first three plot ideas as not unique enough. Required more unexpected/unconventional mystery concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Active Work\n",
      "Just completed Chapter 2. The chapter ends mid-scene with Iris Farkas entering the police station to meet Maya for the first time. This is the moment where Maya begins interacting with the character who will manipulate the entire investigation. The scene was left at: \"Detective Kovač? I'm Iris Farkas. Please, sit down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pending Tasks\n",
      "None explicitly requested. User has not asked for Chapter 3 or further development, but the natural continuation would be drafting subsequent chapters.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Central mystery elements**:\n",
      "- 6 weeks of map thefts before murder (library, historical society, ranger station, 4 GPS units from cars)\n",
      "- Elena Farkas: 89-year-old cartographer, murdered in her home studio, all maps stolen, she was burning maps before death\n",
      "- Hidden community: 8 families, settlement called \"Millbrook Heights\" (ironic name), living 3 miles into forest on unmapped trails, on land owned by Consolidated Mountain Properties\n",
      "- Elena falsified maps for 60 years, showing empty forest where community exists\n",
      "- Thomas Wade will be revealed as accidental killer (pushed Elena during argument, she hit drafting table)\n",

      "- Elena's accurate maps hidden in storage unit by Iris, showing continuous occupation since 1962\n",
      "\n",
      "**Character details**:\n",
      "- Maya Kovač: 27, detective for \"four months and six days\" at start, from Denver PD, requested Millbrook assignment, drives Honda Civic, color-codes everything, obsessively organized, immigrant parents (Balkan grandmother with false papers), childhood friend deported at age 8\n",
      "- Warren Hayes: retiring in 6 weeks to Scottsdale, will recommend Maya as chief\n",
      "- Iris Farkas: 32, high school art teacher, paint-stained flannel shirt, has been manipulating investigation to get maps into evidence\n",
      "- Elena Farkas: lived on Ridgeline Road, had studio attached to house, made all official maps for region for 60 years, killed ~10 PM with head trauma (drafting table corner)\n",
      "- Margaret Yates: 70s, neighbor who discovered body during morning dog walk\n",
      "- Scott Chen: 35, forest ranger, father Leon Chen (67) lives in hidden community (estranged)\n",
      "- Daniel Reeves: 41, corporate surveyor for Consolidated Mountain Properties\n",

      "- Grace Wade: 17, Thomas's daughter\n",
      "- Sofia Hernandez: 28, community member with children\n",
      "\n",
      "**Timeline established in chapters**:\n",
      "- Maya arrives October (gray morning)\n",
      "- First alarm set for 6:00 AM Day 2\n",
      "- Hayes calls 6:45 AM: Elena's body discovered ~6:25 AM by Margaret Yates\n",
      "- Death occurred previous evening ~10 PM (10-14 hours before discovery)\n",
      "- Map thefts began 6 weeks prior\n",
      "- Consolidated purchased land \"last month\" (one month before current timeline)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Physical descriptions from chapters**:\n",
      "- Police station: attached to town hall, concrete building, smells like \"burned coffee and printer toner\"\n",
      "- Maya's apartment: above hardware store on Main Street, one bedroom, shower from \"Reagan administration,\" two-burner stove\n",
      "- Elena's house: ranch-style, weathered cedar siding, workshop attached, Ridgeline Road (10 minutes from town)\n",
      "- Elena's studio: north-facing windows, flat files, drafting table, fireplace in corner with metal waste bin\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key quotes to preserve tone**:\n",
      "- Maya on rules: \"safety came from being beyond reproach, from giving the system no reason to notice you\"\n",
      "- Hayes on Elena: \"If Elena said something existed, it existed. And if her maps said something wasn't there...\"\n",
      "- Scott on Elena's accuracy: \"Elena's maps are gospel\"\n",
      "- Hayes cryptically: \"sometimes the maps we draw aren't just about geography. They're about protecting what we love\"\n"

    "### How the Caching Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is in `_add_cache_control()` and `_create_session_memory_cached()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Mark the last conversation message with cache_control\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"role\": \"user\",\n",
    "    \"content\": [{\n",
    "        \"type\": \"text\",\n",
    "        \"text\": msg[\"content\"],\n",
    "        \"cache_control\": {\"type\": \"ephemeral\"}  # <-- This creates a cache breakpoint\n",
    "    }]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Also mark the system prompt\n",
    "system=[{\n",
    "    \"type\": \"text\",\n",
    "    \"text\": \"You are a session memory agent...\",\n",
    "    \"cache_control\": {\"type\": \"ephemeral\"}\n",
    "}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:**\n",
    "- The first background update creates a cache entry for `[System + Messages]`\n",
    "- Subsequent updates with the same message prefix get **cache hits**\n",
    "- Only the new summarization instruction is billed at full price\n",
    "- Cache entries have a 5-minute TTL, so rapid updates benefit most\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost math:**\n",
    "- Without caching: 5,000 tokens × $3.00/1M = $0.015 per update\n",
    "- With caching: 500 new tokens × $3.00/1M + 4,500 cached × $0.30/1M = $0.00285\n",
    "- **Savings: ~80%** on background summarization costs"
